Simple Session Storage Example

I wanted to write something that used [sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage#sessionStorage "DOM Storage") and so I wrote this while following 
a tutorial from [Tuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-submit-a-form-with-control-enter/ "How to Submit a Form with Control + Enter").
